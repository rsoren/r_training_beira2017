# LISTS
# list, as.list
# str
# index by [], [[]] and $

#   -- Challenge: 
#      1. Create a list called 'my_list' that contains 
#           an element with 1, 2, 3 and another element with "a", "b", "c"
#      2. Have R give you the contents of the second element
#         The output should look like: "a" "b" "C"
#           




# DATA FRAMES
#   data.frame, head, tail
#   index data frames with $ (like a list) and [] (like a matrix)
#   -- for creating new variables
#   subset rows and columns with the subset() function
#   'dplyr' package -- more on this later





# SUMMARIZING DATA
#   str, class
#   table, summary, mean, sd



# READING, WRITING, and CHANGING FILES
#   write.csv, read.csv
#   saveRDS, readRDS
#   'foreign' package for other file types
#   -- example with Access database
#   help(files)


# OTHERS
# lm, plot, abline, 

# INSPECTING THE OBJECTS and the ENVIRONMENT
# ls, getwd, setwd, list.files


#####
# CHALLENGES

#-- Insert the number 168 between 12 and 13
#   using ONLY operations on 'x' (don't just rewrite the whole vector)
x <- c(88, 5, 12, 13)
